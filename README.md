## Overview

One Contact Manager is a web-based application that allows users to securely register, log in, and manage a personal list of contacts. Each user has their own private contact list that can be searched, sorted, paginated, added to, edited, and deleted — all through a modern, responsive UI.

---

## Features

- **User Authentication** — Register and log in with a username and password. Sessions are maintained via browser cookies.
- **Contact CRUD** — Create, read, update, and delete contacts with name, phone number, and email.
- **Live Search** — Debounced search filters contacts in real time as you type.
- **Sort by Name** — Click the Name column header to toggle A→Z / Z→A sorting.
- **Pagination** — Contacts are displayed 8 per page with numbered navigation controls.
- **Avatar Initials** — Each contact displays a color-coded avatar generated from their initials.
- **Duplicate Detection** — Warns before creating a contact with the same name or phone number as an existing one.
- **Input Validation** — Name, phone, and email are validated client-side before any API call is made.
- **Responsive Design** — Works on desktop and mobile with a glassmorphism dark theme.
- **Accessibility** — ARIA labels, live regions, semantic landmarks, and keyboard navigation throughout.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A LAMP server (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP 8+)
- A web browser

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/one-contact-manager.git
   cd one-contact-manager
   ```

2. **Deploy frontend files** to your Apache web root
   ```bash
   cp -r * /var/www/html/
   ```

3. **Deploy PHP backend** files to your server's API directory
   ```bash
   cp -r LAMPAPI/ /var/www/html/LAMPAPI/
   ```

4. **Set up the MySQL database** — create a database and a `users` and `contacts` table. Update your PHP files with the correct DB credentials.

5. **Update the API base URL** in `Index.js` if hosting on a different server:
   ```js
   const urlBase = "http://your-server.com/LAMPAPI";
   ```

6. Open `index.html` in a browser to get started.

## Usage

1. **Register** a new account on the Sign Up page.
2. **Log in** with your credentials — you'll be redirected to the dashboard.
3. **Search** contacts using the search bar (live, debounced).
4. **Sort** contacts A→Z or Z→A by clicking the Name column header.
5. **Add** a contact with the `+ Add Contact` button — validation and duplicate checks run before saving.
6. **Edit** a contact using the pencil icon — the form pre-fills with existing data.
7. **Delete** a contact using the trash icon — a confirmation prompt appears first.
8. **Sign out** using the Sign Out button in the top right.
